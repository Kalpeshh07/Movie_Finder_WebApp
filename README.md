I built Movie Finder, a responsive React-based web application that allows users to search for movies using real-time data from an external movie API (like TMDB). It lets users explore movie details such as the title, release date, rating, poster, and a short overview. This project helped me improve my skills in API integration, React state management, and building clean, user-friendly interfaces.
